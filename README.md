### Project Title
Analyzing the US Bikeshare Data

### Description
Analyzing the bike sharing system dataset across major cities in the US

In this project, data was provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. The scope of this analysis also covers the comparision of the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

There has been a significant increase in the proliferation and adoption of bicycle-sharing systems in cities worldwide. These systems enable users to easily rent bicycles for brief periods at an affordable cost, facilitating the convenient borrowing of bikes from one location (point A) and returning them at another (point B) hence this project was carried out to understudy the trend, discover insights and make meaningful recommmendations.

This analysis was done using python
