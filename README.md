### Project Title
Analyzing the US Bikeshare Data

### Description
Exploring Bike Share Data from Major US Cities

This project delves into the dataset from Motivate, a prominent bike share system provider serving numerous major cities in the United States. Its aim is to uncover trends in bike share usage, with a specific focus on comparing system usage across three significant urban centers: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

The growth and widespread adoption of bicycle-sharing systems in cities worldwide have been remarkable. These systems allow users to conveniently rent bikes for short durations at an affordable rate, making it easy to pick up a bicycle at one location (point A) and return it at another (point B). Therefore, this project was undertaken to analyze these trends, extract valuable insights, and formulate practical recommendations.

Python was employed to conduct this analysis
